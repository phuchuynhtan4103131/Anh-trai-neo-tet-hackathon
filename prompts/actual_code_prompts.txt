# Core Game Logic
"Implement core game mechanics:
- Player movement and physics
- Collision detection system
- Level management
- Question system
- Score tracking"

# Health and Lives System
"Create a health system that:
- Maintains 3 total lives across all stages
- Reduces health on hazard collision
- Resets position on damage
- Resets to level 1 on death
- Persists health between levels"

# Score Implementation
"Develop scoring system with:
- +100 points for correct answers
- +20 points for checkpoints
- -20 points for hazard hits
- Best score tracking
- Score persistence"

# Animation System
"Implement animations for:
- Player movement states
- Death sequence
- Damage feedback
- Visual effects
- UI transitions"

# Game State Management
"Create state management for:
- Level progression
- Health tracking
- Score persistence
- Question tracking
- Checkpoint system"
