# Core Game Logic
"Implement core game mechanics:
- Player movement and physics
- Collision detection system
- Level management
- Question system
- Score tracking"

# Health and Lives System
"Create a health system that:
- Maintains 3 total lives across all stages
- Reduces health on hazard collision
- Resets position on damage
- Resets to level 1 on death
- Persists health between levels"

# Score Implementation
"Develop scoring system with:
- +100 points for correct answers
- +20 points for checkpoints
- -20 points for hazard hits
- Best score tracking
- Score persistence"

# Animation System
"Implement animations for:
- Player movement states
- Death sequence
- Damage feedback
- Visual effects
- UI transitions"

# Game State Management
"Create state management for:
- Level progression
- Health tracking
- Score persistence
- Question tracking
- Checkpoint system"

# Player Physics Refinement
"Implement advanced player movement:
- Variable jump height based on button hold duration
- Coyote time window for jump forgiveness
- Wall bounce and hazard knockback effects
- Smooth acceleration and deceleration
- Air control and momentum
- Edge detection and handling"

# Question System Enhancement
"Develop robust question handling:
- Dynamic question loading and display
- Answer validation and scoring
- Progress tracking across levels
- Reward distribution system
- Visual feedback animations
- Answer history tracking
- Modal interaction handling"

# Level Transition Logic
"Create seamless level transitions:
- State preservation between levels
- Checkpoint management
- Player spawn handling
- Score and health persistence
- Progress saving
- Level unlock conditions
- Transition animations"

# Canvas Rendering Optimization
"Optimize game rendering:
- Efficient sprite handling
- Background parallax effects
- Particle systems for effects
- UI layer management
- Screen shake effects
- Smooth camera follow
- Visual feedback systems"

# Local Storage Implementation
"Implement data persistence:
- High score saving
- Game state management
- Player progress tracking
- Settings persistence
- Question history
- Achievement tracking
- Auto-save functionality"

# Input System
"Create responsive controls:
- Keyboard input handling
- Touch input support
- Input buffering
- Custom key bindings
- Control customization
- Input state management
- Multi-input handling"

# Collision System Enhancement
"Refine collision detection:
- Platform edge handling
- One-way platform logic
- Hazard interaction
- Question block activation
- Checkpoint triggering
- Moving platform support
- Corner case handling"
