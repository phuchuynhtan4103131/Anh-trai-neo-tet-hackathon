Initial Game Concept:
"Create a web-based platformer game that educates players about environmental and social issues in Australia and Vietnam. The game should be engaging, educational, and incorporate quiz elements."

Theme Development:
"Help me develop a theme that combines environmental education with traditional platformer mechanics. The game should teach about climate change, social justice, and community development in Australia and Vietnam."

Character Design:
"Design a character that represents harmony between nature and technology. The character should be simple enough for a 2D platformer but memorable and thematically appropriate."

Game Mechanics:
"What are some unique game mechanics that could reinforce learning about environmental and social issues while keeping the game fun and engaging? Focus on platformer elements combined with educational content."

Level Design Philosophy:
"Help me design a level progression system that gradually introduces more complex environmental and social concepts while increasing gameplay difficulty."
